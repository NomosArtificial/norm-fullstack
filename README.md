 This repository contains a list of laws taken from the fictional series “Game of Thrones” saved under `docs/law.pdf``. Your task is to implement a new service (described in take home exercise document) and provide access to that service via a FastAPI endpoint running in a docker container. Please replace this readme with the steps required to run your app.
